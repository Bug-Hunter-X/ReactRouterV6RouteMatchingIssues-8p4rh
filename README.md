# Unexpected Route Matching in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected route matching and navigation problems.  Routes may not render the expected components, or navigation may fail silently, resulting in a blank screen or the wrong content being displayed.

## Problem

The provided `App.js` file shows a basic React Router setup.  However, under certain conditions (e.g., complex route structures, nested routes, or dynamic segments), the routing may malfunction.

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` file offers a potential fix by carefully reviewing the route definitions, ensuring correct path specifications, and using `useLocation` and `useNavigate` hooks effectively for navigation.  The solution may involve adjustments to route parameters or the overall route structure.
